WealthDesk -- Session 6: Baseline Evaluation (US-05)
=====================================================
 
What you build this session
  A structured evaluation pipeline that runs 40 questions from a golden
  dataset through the Session 5 WealthDesk agent, scores each response,
  and produces a pass-rate report broken down by question category.
 
  Routing is evaluated deterministically (COMPLEX and OUT_OF_SCOPE have
  canned responses with known keywords). SIMPLE responses are scored 1-5
  by an LLM judge. A response passes if it is correctly routed, scores
  >= 3 out of 5, and contains no forbidden content.
 
What is NOT here yet
  - Regression tests comparing scores across commits (Session 12)
 
Run
  python s06/solution/evaluate.py
 
  The script imports the built WealthDesk graph from s05/solution/main.py
  and runs each question with a fresh MemorySaver checkpointer so no
  prior conversation state leaks between evaluation items.
 
Golden dataset
  s06/data/golden_dataset.json  --  40 Q&A items:
    20 SIMPLE  (loan rates, FD rates, branch info, policy)
    10 COMPLEX (financial planning, eligibility)
    10 OUT_OF_SCOPE (off-topic, competitor comparisons)
 
How this file is organised
  1. Configuration        -- thresholds, paths, model choice
  2. LLM judge            -- the second LLM that scores SIMPLE responses
  3. Dataset loading      -- reads and validates golden_dataset.json
  4. Response evaluation  -- scores one response against one dataset item
  5. Evaluation runner    -- loops over all dataset items, calls the graph
  6. Report generation    -- aggregates results into a summary dict
  7. Entry point          -- wires everything together

# Two LLMs are at work in this script:
#   1. The WealthDesk agent LLM (imported from s05) — answers customer questions
#   2. This judge LLM — evaluates the quality of those answers
#
# Keeping them separate means a weak agent model can be evaluated by a stronger
# judge model, and the judge's verdict is independent of how the answer was
# generated. This is the "LLM-as-judge" pattern — common in production evals.
#
# temperature=0.0  → deterministic output; same question always gets same score.
#                    Critical for reproducibility: if you re-run the eval and
#                    the score changes, you want that to reflect a real change
#                    in the agent, not random variation in the judge.
# max_tokens=100   → the judge only needs to output "SCORE: N\nREASON: ..."
#                    which is well under 100 tokens. Keeping this low prevents
#                    the judge from rambling before giving the score.

    Why sys.path.insert?
    S06's evaluate.py needs to import WealthDesk from S05. They live in
    separate directories (s05/solution/ and s06/solution/) and neither is
    installed as a Python package. sys.path.insert(0, ...) adds the s05
    solution directory to Python's module search path so that
    `from wealthdesk.agent import build_graph` resolves correctly.
    The 0 means "look here first" — before site-packages — which avoids
    picking up an older installed version if one exists.
 
    Why MemorySaver and not SqliteSaver?
    MemorySaver keeps checkpoints in RAM. SqliteSaver writes to a file and
    requires a database path. For evaluation we don't need persistence across
    runs — each run is independent — and MemorySaver avoids creating a stale
    checkpoint file that could confuse future runs.
